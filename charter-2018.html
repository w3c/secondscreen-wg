        <h2 id="goals"> Goals </h2>
        <p> Web content is available on an ever expanding array of devices
          including ebook readers, phones, tablets, laptops, auto displays, and
          electronic billboards. These devices have a variety of display
          screens. There are also a variety of mechanisms that allow these
          devices to use secondary display screens available in the local
          environment, attached by wired connections or remotely with wireless,
          peer-to-peer media. </p>
        <p> Common attachment methods include video ports like VGA, DisplayPort
          or HDMI, or wirelessly through Miracast, WiDi, or AirPlay. Wireless
          screens may be available on a local area network or over the Internet,
          brokered by a cloud service. A device like a laptop could provide a
          screen for a smaller device like a phone. </p>
        <p> For many of these techniques the operating system hides how the
          screen is attached and provides ways for native applications to use
          the screens. Native applications on an operating system can easily use
          these additional screens without having to know how they are attached
          to the device. At this point, however, there is no way for a web page
          to take advantage of these available secondary displays. </p>
        <p> The Second Screen Working Group aims at defining simple APIs that
          allow web applications to show and control web content on one or more
          secondary displays. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="scope">
        <h2 id="scope"> Scope </h2>
        <p> The scope of this Working Group is to define an API that allows a
          web application to request display of web content on a connected
          display, with a means to communicate with and control the web content
          from the initiating page and other authorized pages. Pages may become
          authorized to control the web content by virtue of sharing an origin
          with the originating page, explicit user permission, or other
          facilities provided by the user agent. The API will hide the details
          of the underlying connection technologies and use familiar, common web
          technologies for messaging between the authorized pages and the web
          content shown on the secondary display. The web content may comprise
          HTML documents, web media types such as images, audio, video, or
          application-specific media, depending on the capabilities of the
          secondary display for rendering the media. Application-specific media
          includes that whose type is known to the controlling page and the
          connected display, but not necessarily a generic HTML user agent. </p>
        <p> The API will provide a means to identify whether requesting display
          on second screens is likely to be successful, i.e. whether at least
          one secondary screen is available for display. </p>
        <p> The API is agnostic with regard to the display connection used, and
          also works with display connections that support video only, for
          example, a TV connected to a laptop with an HDMI connection. In such a
          usage scenario, the web content displayed on a connected display must
          be rendered and converted to video before it is sent to a second
          screen. The user agent may use whatever means the operating system
          provides to prepare and send the video to a second screen. Any
          interaction between the authorized web pages and the content displayed
          on a secondary screen would happen within the bounds of the initiating
          device since both the pages and the content are rendered on that same
          device, and only a video representation is sent to the second screen.
        </p>
        <p> Alternatively, if the second screen device understands some other
          means of transmitting content to a display and a means of two-way
          message passing, the web content can be rendered by the remote device.
          In this scenario, a URL to the content to be displayed is sent to the
          secondary display to be rendered there. Because the content is
          rendered separately from the initiating user agent, pages hosted by
          other user agents may be authorized to control the remotely rendered
          content at the same time. </p>
        <p> For a requested piece of web content, how and by which device the
          content is rendered is an implementation detail. The user agent is
          responsible for determining which secondary displays are compatible
          with the content that is requested to be shown through the API. </p>
        <p> Sending content to a connected display creates a presentation
          session. Applications can create multiple presentation sessions to
          control multiple displays, although synchronization between them is
          not currently supported by the API. </p>
        <p> The specifications produced by this Working Group will include
          security and privacy considerations. Specifically, the user must
          always be in control of privacy-sensitive information that may be
          conveyed through the APIs, such as the visibility or access to
          secondary displays. </p>
        <p> Members of the Working Group should review other Working Groups'
          deliverables that are identified as being relevant to the Working
          Group's mission. </p>
        <h3 id="success-criteria"> Success Criteria </h3>
        <p> To advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#RecsCR">Proposed
            Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected to have two
          independent implementations of each feature defined in the
          specification. </p>
        <p> To advance to Proposed Recommendation, interoperability between the
          independent implementations should be demonstrated. Interoperable user
          agents hosting the same Presentation API web application should be
          able to render the same content with the same functionality on
          supported secondary displays that are compatible with the content to
          render. </p>
        <h3 id="out-of-scope"> Out of Scope </h3>
        <p> The specifications defined by this Working Group abstract away the
          means of connecting and different connection technologies. For
          example, the following are out of scope: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lower level APIs that expose features of different connection
            technologies </li>
          <li>How second screens are connected to the primary device (e.g. Video
            Port, HDMI, WiDi, Miracast, AirPlay) </li>
          <li>How the user agent prepares and sends the screen contents to the
            second screen </li>
        </ul>
        <p> This Working Group will not define or mandate network protocols for
          sharing content between user agents and secondary displays. For
          example, the following are out of scope: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Discovery of wireless secondary displays by the primary user agent</li>
          <li>Establishment of a messaging channel between the two parties,
            including message addressing, security and authentication</li>
          <li>Negotiation of a media streaming session between devices</li>
          <li>Network transport of media data</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Input methods, such as using a TV remote as a pointer or clicker,
          are out of scope of the Working Group. </p>
        <p> To facilitate interoperability among user agents and display devices
          and encourage adoption of the API, the group may informatively
          reference existing suites of protocols, either directly in the
          Presentation API deliverable or in a non-normative companion Note.
          This Working Group will monitor the outcomes of related discussions in
          the <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/webscreens/">Second Screen
            Community Group</a> in particular. </p>
        <p> Content mirroring, whereby a web application requests display of the
          content shown in its own browsing context (i.e., page) on a secondary
          display, is out of scope. If a web application requests display of
          itself (same URL) on a connected display, a new browsing context will
          be created with that URL and rendered on the connected display. </p>
        <p> This Working Group will not define or mandate any video or audio
          codecs. </p>

              A comprehensive test suite for all features of a specification is
              necessary to assess the specification's robustness, consistency, and
              implementability, and to promote interoperability between user
              agents. Therefore, each specification must have a companion test
              suite, which should be completed before transition to Candidate
              Recommendation, and which must be completed with an implementation
              report before transition to Proposed Recommendation. Additional
              tests may be added to the test suite at any stage of the

          Community Group ceased its work on the Presentation API
          specification. The Community Group is currently focused on incubating
          the <a href="https://github.com/webscreens/openscreenprotocol">Open
          Screen Protocol</a>, an open set of network protocols that includes
          authentication and security mechanisms, for the APIs defined in this
          Working Group. The
          Community Group may also work on other related deliverables where it
          is not clear enough how to proceed for it to be a work item for a
          Working Group. The Community Group is only one possible source for
          work under future Working Group charters, but can serve to do initial
          exploration for some future work items. </p>
        <p> The specifications produced by this Working Group adhere to the
          web's security model defined in the HTML specification published by
          the Web Platform Working Group. </p>
        <p> Common web technologies that this Working Group could refer to for
          messaging include Web Messaging and the Web Socket API defined by the
          Web Platform Working Group. </p>
        <p> No external dependencies against the specifications of this Working
          Group have been identified. </p>
        <h3 id="liaisons"> Liaisons </h3>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/Charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a title="Technical Architecture Group" href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including <a title="First Public Working Draft" href="https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#RecsWD">FPWD</a> and at least 3 months before <a title="Candidate Recommendation" href="https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#RecsCR">CR</a>, and should be issued when major changes occur in a specification.</p>
        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

          <h2 id="participation"> Participation </h2>
          <p> To be successful, the Second Screen Working Group is expected to
            have 6 or more active participants for its duration, and to have
            the participation of industry leaders in fields relevant to the
            specifications it produces. </p>
          <p> The Chairs and specification Editors are expected to contribute
            half a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no
            minimum requirement for other Participants. This Working Group will
            also allocate the necessary resources for building Test Suites for
            each specification. </p>
          <p> The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical
            submissions for consideration, with the agreement from each
            participant to Royalty-Free licensing of those submissions under the
            W3C Patent Policy. </p>

          <h2 id="communication"> Communication </h2>
          <p> Teleconferences will be conducted on an as-needed basis. </p>
          <p> This group primarily conducts its work on the public mailing list
            <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-secondscreen/">public-secondscreen@w3.org</a>.
            Administrative tasks may be conducted in Member-only communications.
          </p>
          <p> Information about the group (deliverables, participants,
            face-to-face meetings, teleconferences, etc.) is available from the

        <div class="decisions">
          <h2 id="decisions"> Decision Policy </h2>
          <p>
            This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due
            process, per the
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#Consensus">W3C
            Process Document (section 3.3)</a>. Typically, an editor or other
            participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in
            discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and
            consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but
            consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range
            of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and
            record a decision along with any objections.
          </p>
          <p>
            To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation,
            any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a
            face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered
            provisional.
          </p>
          <p>
            A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for
            example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period
            from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's
            evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the
            response period, the resolution will be considered to have
            consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
          </p>
          <p>
            All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved
            unless and until new information becomes available, or unless
            reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
